Scene 1: 
You decide to leave the cursed skull alone. Maybe you are getting a bit too old for this careless adventurer's life. You return to civilization and visit your home town. You become a history teacher in the local college and divert your passion from exploring ancient civilizations to teaching about them.

Scene 2: 
After a few years in your home town, you meet a fellow teacher. She is kind and caring, you fall in love and start a family. As the pursuit of artifacts leaves your system, it is replaced with far more important things, like the pursuit of diapers. It is a simpler life, but you're happy.

Scene 3: 
The years go by much faster than you imagined, you've grown tired but content. As your body fails you with old age, you lie in bed and ponder about all of your old choices. Could your life have been more exciting? Maybe. You look deeply at your loved ones' eyes, as they stand around you. Sleep overcomes you.
